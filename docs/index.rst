Welcome to the Wii U Homebrew Documentation!
==================================================

Wii U homebrew development is not an easy task for beginners and professionals alike. As the group behind the **Wii U Homebrew Documentation Project** we want to change that and provide you with a smooth start into the world of homebrew development. 

In these docs you can find guides to:

#. Get the development environment up and running in Quick Start
#. Understand how to interact with various APIs provided by CafeOS
#. How to easily log and debug homebrew remotely
#. How to develop plugins for the Wii U Plugin System (WUPS)

and many more! But that's not it, in our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/dibas/wii-u-homebrew-docs>`_ you will also find example projects, from finished templates you can kickstart your homebrew with to code snippets that demonstrate how to utilize various features of the Wii U platform.
